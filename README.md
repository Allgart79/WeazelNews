# Interactive Weazel News for FiveM RP Server

This project is an interactive web application designed to emulate a Weazel News interface for use within a FiveM RP (Roleplay) server. It provides a platform for players to browse news articles, watch videos, and interact with various elements of the news site.

## Features:

- **Dynamic Content**: Display dynamically updated news articles, headlines, and videos to provide a realistic news experience for players.
  
- **Interactive Elements**: Implement interactive elements such as clickable headlines, video players, and comment sections to engage players with the news content.
  
- **Customization Options**: Allow server administrators to easily customize the content, layout, and branding of the Weazel News site to suit their RP server's theme.
  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Utilize WebSocket technology or AJAX polling to deliver real-time updates on new articles, breaking news, and server events directly to the news site.
  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the news site is responsive and mobile-friendly, allowing players to access it seamlessly from various devices and screen sizes.
